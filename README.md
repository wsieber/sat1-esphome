<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
The Satellite1 ESPHome firmware should be flashed on your [FutureProofHomes Core Board](https://futureproofhomes.net/products/satellite1-core-board). For flashing instructions please visit [Docs.FutureProofHomes.net](https://docs.futureproofhomes.net).  After the firmware is successfully flashed and your Core Board is connected to your Wifi it will appear in your Home Assistant as a new device called "Satellite1".

## Key Features of the Firmware
- Works with the Home Assistant Platform so you can control your home.
- This firmware enables your FutureProofHomes Core Board to mount with our [HAT board](https://futureproofhomes.net/products/satellite1-top-microphone-board) which then unlocks:
- On-Demand flashing of our open source XMOS firmware for audio echo cancellation and other audio processing algorithms.
- [On-Device WakeWord support.](https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord)
- Temperature/Humidity/Light sensor readings of the room
- Attachable mmWave Radar for Human Presence Detection
- Music streaming via HA Media Browser or [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/)
- Volume Up/Down & Action Buttons
- Hardware & Software Mute Buttons
- 360 degree LEDs & Notification Animations
- Support for TTS Announcements via Home Assistant
- USB-C Power Delivery for easy power input


## Why Open Source?
We believe it is irresponsible to ask customers to trust that our microphone and AI in-a-box protects your privacy.  To hold ourselves and the whole world accountable it is prudent to open-source our work so that we can all benefit from this amazing technology.  Let's build together.

## Why Purchase from FutureProofHomes?
Put simply, your purchase helps fund our team and further innovation.  Also, the FutureProofHomes team will work hard to give you top-quality products that are tested, fully-functional, in stock (as often as possible) and lead with great community support.  You can purchase Satellite1 components individually, or purchase the entire devkit as a package.  Help us, help you!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Go to [Docs.FutureProofHomes.net](https://docs.futureproofhomes.net) and follow the instructions to assemble, flash and set up your Core Board.

<!-- This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->

### Prerequisites

- FutureProofHomes Core Board & USB-C cable to plug into your computer.
- Highly recommend our FutureProofHomes HAT board to unlock all the features.

<!-- This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ``` -->

## Customizing the Firmware
### ESPHome Device Builder
The easiest way to build customized firmware for your Satellite1 is through the ESPHome Device Builder dashboard. For a detailed guide, see https://docs.futureproofhomes.net/satellite1-modifying-the-firmware/. 

>**Note:** Due to breaking changes between ESPHome firmware releases, you must ensure that your ESPHome Device Builder version is compatible with the Satellite1 codebase configured in your YAML file. By default, the codebase targets the latest beta release (`staging` branch).
Before updating your ESPHome Device Builder, verify that the latest Satellite1 firmware beta release officially supports the ESPHome version. Failure to do so may result in build failures or unstable device behavior.

### Terminal Builds
Create/activate environment by running from project root:
```bash
source scripts/setup_build_env.sh
```

```bash
esphome compile config/satellite1.yaml
```

Upload firmware to your Core Board:
```bash
esphome upload config/satellite1.yaml
```

Tail the ESPHome logs:
```bash
esphome logs config/satellite1.yaml
```
